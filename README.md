# Ruby Calculator Challenge

## Prerequisites

-   [ga-wdi-boston/ruby-vs-js-arrays](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/ruby-vs-js-arrays)
-   [ga-wdi-boston/ruby-vs-js-hash-dictionary](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/ruby-vs-js-hash-dictionary)
-   [ga-wdi-boston/ruby-vs-js-objects](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/ruby-vs-js-objects)

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, developers should be able to:

-   Create new instances of a `Calculator` class
-   Access calculator methods from this class within `pry` when
running `ruby bin/calc.rb`
-   Return `Floats` vs `Fixnums` for true values

## Instructions

In [`bin/calc.rb`](bin/calc.rb), create a Calculator Class with calculation
methods for each of the following operations:

-   Addition
-   Subtraction
-   Multiplication
-   Division
-   Square
-   Square Roots

Each calculation method should expect the appropriate number of arguments
required to complete the operation.

After running `ruby bin/calc.rb`, and in your `pry` console, you should be able
 to create a new instance of your Calculator class, and then call each
 calculation method from this instance.

You may wish to leverage Ruby's [Math module](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Math.html)
for square roots.

*Be aware of whether your methods are returning Float or Fixnum results.*
